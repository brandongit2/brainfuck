# Brandon's Brainfuck interpreter

**Usage:** The interpreter can be used two ways:

- `node index.js [programId]`, where `[programId]` is the number of the program you want to execute. The programs
  are listed in the `programs` array of `index.js`.
- `node index.js "[program]"`, where `[program]` is a Brainfuck program.
